# Archive

This folder is a lightweight local archive to capture learnings as the project evolves.

Suggested usage:
- `decisions/` — short ADR-style notes (date + context + decision)
- `retros/` — milestone retrospectives (what worked / what didn’t / next)
- `spikes/` — experiments and findings

These notes help future-you understand *why* the template looks the way it does.
